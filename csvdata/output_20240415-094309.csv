As someone with a diverse background spanning peace research, advocacy, and project management, I am eager to contribute my unique set of skills to create a vibrant and exceptional environment in your esteemed establishment. 
<br> 
<br>My journey in peace research began at New York University, where I collaborated on a UNESCO chair project with the University of Mosul. Engaging in comprehensive literature reviews and crafting qualitative research frameworks, I honed my ability to collaborate with diverse teams, skills crucial for the dynamic responsibilities of a Lounge Manager. 
<br> 
<br>Stepping into the role of Founder and CEO of IYMUN, I orchestrated the inaugural international youth conference in Iraq. Managing advocacy and communication efforts, I navigated the complexities of writing and editing digital marketing materials, developing comprehensive stakeholder engagement strategies, and advocating for policy changes. This experience has instilled in me a strong knack for networking and relationship building—an asset for fostering connections in the lounge. 
<br> 
<br>My tenure as a Goodwill Ambassador for Youth of Iraq and President of the Human Rights Unit at IHRC deepened my commitment to social causes. Through impactful advocacy, strategic partnership development, and pioneering public education programs, I elevated human rights awareness and represented the organization at global events. These roles have cultivated my ability to represent and communicate effectively, essential skills for engaging guests and clients in a lounge setting. 
<br> 
<br>Venturing into education as an Advanced Facilitator and Trainer at Penn State University, I cultivated a dynamic approach to facilitation, encouraging active listening and communication among participants. Simultaneously, my experience as an Admin and Logistics Officer at Mercy Hands for Humanitarian Aids equipped me with project management skills, including budgeting, procurement, and stakeholder engagement. 
<br> 
<br>Founding the English Corner Institute in Mosul, I embraced the responsibilities of developing a business plan, overseeing financial aspects, and managing a team. This experience sharpened my marketing skills, attracting students and fostering enhanced English language proficiency among Arabic speakers. 
<br> 
<br>Transitioning to the role of ELI Coordinator at the American University of Kurdistan, I not only taught ESL using modern methods but also managed office workflows, performed basic bookkeeping, and coordinated schedules for company conferences and meetings. 
<br> 
<br>Now, turning my attention to the Lounge Manager position, I am excited to bring this rich tapestry of experiences to create a welcoming and vibrant atmosphere. Addressing the outlined duties and responsibilities: 
<br> 
<br>Team Leadership and Development: 
<br> 
<br>My history of leading diverse teams positions me well to inspire, motivate, and develop the lounge team. 
<br>Training and Development: 
<br> 
<br>Crafting personal development plans for team members is a practice I have actively implemented, ensuring continuous progression and learning. 
<br>Guest Experience Enhancement: 
<br> 
<br>My commitment to seeking constant guest feedback aligns seamlessly with the goal of enhancing the lounge product and addressing concerns promptly. 
<br>Health and Safety Compliance: 
<br> 
<br>Having overseen various projects, I am well-versed in adhering to health and safety regulations, a critical aspect of ensuring a secure environment for guests. 
<br>I am genuinely enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to the success of your establishment. I would be delighted to discuss how my narrative and diverse experiences align with the vision and needs of your organization in person. 
<br> 
<br>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity for an interview.

<br> 
<br>I am writing to express my strong interest in the Production Support Engineer position. With a Bachelor's degree in Oil and Gas Engineering, and a background in petroleum engineering and related fields, I am confident that my technical skills, strong problem-solving abilities, and commitment to continuous learning make me an ideal candidate for this role. 
<br> 
<br>In my current role as a Cost Engineer at Ras Al Khaimah Oil Services &amp; Energy Co. Ltd, I have been responsible for ensuring the efficient progress of ongoing projects. I have effectively utilized project management and scheduling software, including Primavera P6, MS Project, and Excel, to create and update project plans and schedules. This experience has equipped me with a strong understanding of project management, which I believe will be valuable in coordinating software updates and upgrades while minimizing disruption to users' workflows in the Production Support Engineer role. 
<br> 
<br>My experience as a Trainee in a StartUP program allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the oil and gas industry, its technologies, and the challenges it faces. During this program, I also became proficient in using software tools relevant to the industry, which is an essential skill for supporting subsurface applications effectively. 
<br> 
<br>Additionally, my summer internship at Basrah Oil Company (BOC) provided me with hands-on experience in the Well Operations Department, where I developed knowledge of artificial lift methods such as Electric Submersible Pumps (ESP) and Gas Lift. This experience aligns well with the need to optimize software performance and enhance data processing speed, improving the user experience. 
<br>I have also pursued additional training and certifications, including Google Project Management, IOSH Managing Safely, and Artificial Lift Life Cycle &amp; Optimization. These certifications reflect my commitment to staying abreast of industry trends, technological advancements, and best practices, as outlined in the job description. 
<br>In conclusion, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the success of Rumaila Operating Organization as a Production Support Engineer. My educational background, technical skills, and hands-on experience in the oil and gas industry, coupled with my commitment to continuous learning and community involvement, make me a strong fit for this role. I am eager to bring my expertise to your organization and contribute to the effective support and optimization of subsurface data management applications. 
<br> 
<br>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my skills and experiences align with your needs in greater detail.

<br> 
<br>I had passed my Electronics Engineering degree in 1st division in 2010.

<br>I am a chemical engineer by profession having more than 8 years of experience in refinery operations and commissioning. I did my bachelors in Chemical Engineer from NED university of Engineering &amp; technology, Karachi, Pakistan. After graduation, I joined National Refinery Limited (NRL) as trainee Engineer where I was assigned to diesel hydro treating unit (DHT) as a DCS operator. 
<br>I worked for 05 years (from 2016 to 2021) in NRL, which is the largest refining complex in the country. My duties are not only to monitor day-to-day operating parameters but also to ensure smooth operation of the unit. I also participated in commissioning activities as well and performed several tasks like line purging, steam blowing, hot and cold oil flushing, catalyst loading, and catalyst sulfiding. I also took active part in master startup of the unit from DCS with Honeywell version Experian PKS R430.1. 
<br>Later on, I joined GS E&amp;C as a DCS operator on DHT unit at Karbala Refinery Project, Iraq where I took part in pre-commissioning and commissioning activities. I witnessed activities like air blowing, steam blowing, lube oil flushing and amine greasing activities for piping lines. I checked loop testing and function testing from DCS. Verified control logics and cause &amp; effects from DCS. 
<br>Currently, I am working as a DCS operator on Mild hydrocracking unit in Dangote refinery, Nigeria having feed capacity of 148,000 BPSD.

<br>Write here the description... My name is Viraj Malintha jayawickrama. I live in Sri Lanka. I am 
<br>thirty one years old and I am a married person. I have two children. My profession is fire 
<br>service and currently I am working in the fire department of Kurunegala Municipality for 
<br>about two years. Also, before working in the Kurunegala Fire Fighting Unit, I completed eight 
<br>years of service in the Fire Fighting Unit of the Sri Lanka Air Force and retired as usual, then 
<br>worked as a Chief Fire Officer in the Sri Lanka Ministry of Labor for about two years and then 
<br>joined the Kurunegala Municipal Fire Fighting Unit. Joined and currently working there. 
<br>Joined 24th July 2012 the Sri Lanka Air Force where he studied the beginner training course of 
<br>the Sri Lanka Air Force Diyathalawa Academia Training School for about six months and then 
<br>the basic training course on firefighting at the Sri Lanka Air Force Ekala Vocational Training 
<br>School and then attached to the Sri Lanka Air Force. He has served in the firefighting units of 
<br>various camps. Actively contributed mainly to the aircraft firefighting service and domestic 
<br>firefighting service and performed my service without deterioration in various fire accidents 
<br>that happened in the country as well as in various natural disasters, accidents and acts of 
<br>terrorism. Studied many different courses fire fighter basic training course ,military first aid 
<br>training ,military combat training course ,air sea rescue cou,rope rescue course ,jungle rescue 
<br>and mmanagement course cover are among them. 
<br>During this period, on 14th April 2012, when the Meethotamulla garbage dump in Sri Lanka 
<br>collapsed, I actively contributed to saving lives there, where four small children who were 
<br>trapped inside a house saved me regardless of my own life and Sri Lanka Air Force. He was 
<br>also appreciated by the Commander of the Army. In 2017, I received the Air Force 
<br>Commander's Courageous Outstanding Servant Award. And I have also done life saving 
<br>activities with the help of ropes by airplanes during floods in Sri Lanka. I have served Sri 
<br>Lanka Government and Sri Lanka Air Force in various ways and sometimes as a fire man, 
<br>sometimes as a lifeguard and sometimes as a security officer. 
<br>Due to the training and knowledge and self-confidence I received from the Sri Lankan Air 
<br>Force, I contributed generously in various terrorist activities during my service. The simplest 
<br>example of that is that I was involved in the search and rescue operation launched by that 
<br>terrorist on April 21, 2019, when the Muslim extremists bombed. In addition, during thecorona disaster that affected the entire world, I contributed to the needs of Sri Lankans as 
<br>well as tourists who came to our country during quarantine and other services. On 24th July 
<br>2012 I left the Sri Lanka Air Force due to my personal reasons after completing my eight year 
<br>engagement. After that, I have worked as a Chief Officer for two years attached to the 
<br>Ministry of Labour’s Private Sector. There, the duty assigned to me was the fire safety work of 
<br>a 34 storey apartment building and the training work on being a security duty and the work of 
<br>saving lives and property. 
<br>On 15th February 2022 I joined the Kurunegala Municipality Fire Fighting Unit and am 
<br>currently working there. My duty is to serve domestic fire and save life and property. In this 
<br>letter I have told about myself, my career and my work experience, the knowledge and 
<br>experience I have in various fields and I have a very strong desire to work in a foreign country 
<br>using my experience and knowledge. In my resume and in this letter, if you are interested in 
<br>my services, I kindly request you to provide me with a job that matches my qualifications.
