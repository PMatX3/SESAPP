The product is for recruitment agencies that has a large database and wants to
use AI to actively search that database to find the most suitable candidate using all the text in their CV and application rather than creating a Boolean search of one or more keywords.

The product is called BESTCANDIDATE.AI

The app will initially run on a laptop or desktop device and ultimately will be run on a mobile app.

Using a text or voice interface the recruiter can find the best candidate easily.

Currently, manual searches are based on keywords normally for a specific role. The results of such a search often returns a long list of possible candidates (typically between 50 and 100) and this list requires a manual review to filter and identify the most suitable candidates in conjunction with the data from the CVs which is not stored in the database.

This process is both time consuming and challenging to ensure that the best possible list of candidates are identified (especially as there is normally a limit of the number of candidates of between 5 and 10 people that can be put forward to the client)

The application will allow the recruiter to easily and speedily use the information from the job descriptions and the rich information generally included in a CV and other background information to identify the best candidate which the Boolean search and current method does not allow.

The application will
 a. import data from the Recruitly database using both Arabic and English
    b. import the data from the CVs
    c. import the job description
    d. allow additional prompts to be added to refine the query
 e. run a query on ChatGPT
 f. produce a list of candidates based on the best match between the job descriptions, recruitly and CVs
